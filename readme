This is the bit for finding out the number of times a given keyword is found in a particular year. In earlier versions, this was intended to find out if searching particular words was even feasible. While a particular word, (let's say "comet") might show up a fair number of times, that doesn't tell us whether there's a particular year in which the term is used so often that it effectively becomes too much to easily process. This also allows one to check for words that might return too many or too few results in general. While this doesn't produce totals for each word count, it allows a sort of cursory inspection that yields frequencies per year.

A secondary function of this keyword count is to provide a reference to double check the actual API calls of all the specified items. This is shown in the data flow diagram.

There are some open questions about how this will all implement in the case of adding just one or two words, but that should not present an insurmountable problem.
